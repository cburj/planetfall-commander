## Factions
### HIVE
#### About
The hive is an Alien faction comprised of upto 10 different "Legions", ranging from the "First Legion" upto the "Tenth Legion". The higher the number of the legion, the more damage they can inflict upon the commanders. These serve as multipliers for any tactics that deal damage. Commanders facing the hive will not know which Legion is being played in a turn - so the Hive can chose to deceive the commanders, if they deem the risk to be worth the reward.

The hive itself has a shared health-pool of 25,000 - once it reaches zero the game ends, and the commanders are victorious.

#### Tactics
Tactics can be purchased at the start of each round - in exchange for giving up the opportunity for dealing damage. Tactics can be purchased using Legion Tokens at the start of each turn - after collecting the standard 1 Legion Token.

Tactics Include:
- 1000 Damage Attack
- 2000 Damage Attack
- 3000 Damage Attack
- Commander Token Steal
- 1000 Damage Block
- 2000 Damage Block
- Regroup (Re-shuffles all Legion cards and places them face down)

### COMMANDERS
#### Commanders work together as a team to deal damage to the Hive - using their own special tactics, bought using commander tokens (1:1 with Legion Tokens). Unlike the Hive, commanders can chose to expose a Hive Legion at the start of their turn. If guessed correctly, the Legion is placed face up and cannot be hidden again (unless the hive plays a regroup) - this means that the commanders can better focus their tactics to desireable legions. However, if they fail to expose the correct legion, the commander is dealt the damage described on the Legion card - e.g. 10th Legion will deal 10000 damage. So the Hive can use trickery to bait commanders into thinking they have an easy target, when infact it is a strong legion.

Commanders themselves have a wide range of tactics which can also be used to deal damage to the hive - these tactics will result in the hive losing overall health.
